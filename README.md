# MHTML-Viewer

An Android App without ads that lets you view and save mhtml files. Uses WebView's saveWebArchive method.

### Permissions

- Internet - Let's the webView access the internet.
- Read/Write Files - Needed to save and read mhtml files. Can't save to or read from SD cards or anything like that.

### Privacy

This app doesn't collect any data.

### Credits

Uses some filters from EasyList (https://easylist.to/#easylist) for blocking some ads. The filters are just a version of EasyList from Jan 01 2022 stored as a raw resource though, so the app doesn't check for updated EasyList filters. This means the browser doesn't really have great adblocking.
